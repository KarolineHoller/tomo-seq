# Find additional information for your own tomo-seq experiment. Or reproduce our results on zebrafish embryos.

## How to run your experiment: 

1. Primers for tomo-seq can be found in the file 'tomoseq_primer_sequences.csv'.

2. A detailed protocol can be found here: Holler K and Junker JP, 2019.

3. Map your sequenced experiment with 'mapping_tomoseq_data.sh'. Depended on the sequencing depth this can take some hours.

4. Analyze the data in your favourite data mining language. We used R and appended our script to reproduce the figures of our paper. That file is named 'tomoseq_data_analysis_danioRerio.R'.
